# Slf4jLogFormatIntentions
Intellij Intention plugin for converting '+' concatenated strings into slf4j log format strings. 

# Deprecated
Jetbrains has added an equivalent of this now, which works in batch formatting. 
In Settings there is `Editor | Inspections | Java | Logging ` there is now `Non-constant string concatenation as argument to logging call`.
